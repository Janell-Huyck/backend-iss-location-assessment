                                I Wonder Why 

                     I wonder why the sky is up, and why the stars abound?
                     And why the Sun comes up each morn, and why the Earth goes ’round?
                     I wonder what the Sun on Mars, would bring at dusk and dawn?
                     I wonder what two moons would say, from Earth lit sky when Sun is gone
                     I wonder if Mars mountain crags would be a sight to hold?
                     I wonder if I’d dare to climb, how could I be so bold!
                     I wonder when Man’s mind will grow, and cease to be so small
                     I wonder when we’ll venture forth, I hope before we fall
                     I wonder if we’ll never dare, to reach up through the sky
                     Forever doomed to live on Earth, and this, I wonder why?
